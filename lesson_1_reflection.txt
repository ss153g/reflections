How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It immediately identified the line # making it fairly simple to review both version of the lines.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can see changes made throughout the life of the file and revert back to an older version if needed.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros are that you can go back to a specific change when you made it.
	cons are that you can forget to save it and thus lose changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    this helps see all related change in one place and therefore does not require to hunt for other files that were changed.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log, git log --stat, git diff id1 id2

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    you can go back and keep checking things using the checkout feature

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Finally write some code and see it in action!
