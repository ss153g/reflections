What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Initialize a directory makes it part of git and therefore we can run git functions on.
	We need it so we can commit changes to it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is where we setup the files we need to be part of a respository (bundled) whereas the working directory can consist of many other files not part of the repository.
