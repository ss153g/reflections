When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    Remote directories can be helpful when you are sharing your code with others. Local copy is helpful when I am the only one working on it or I wanted to try an experimental feature before sharing with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    This will help making sure that only changes that I want are the ones that made to the GitHub repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

	fork - GitHub only, is the ability to create a clone of a repository in GitHub into my GitHub repository.
	clone - The ability to copy the entire repository from server to local or local to local.
	branch - is the ability to create a separate code base within a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
